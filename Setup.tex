\section{Setup}\label{sec:setup}

	% Noch Kapitelreferenz rausnehmen, da dass jetz in einem Kapitel zusammengefasst ist.
	This chapter includes the stand of the NIM prototype as it was in January 2018 (Chap. \ref{subsubsec:setupProto}). During test campaigns (Chap. bla) some parts such as the reflectron and the antechamber were exchanged and tested on the prototype. In May 2019 the tests with the NIM ProtoFlight Model (PFM) started. Chapter \ref{subsubsec:setupPFM} describes the NIM PFM as it was at the beginning of the test campaign. During the tests, improvements had to be done such as adaptations of the ion source and improvements on the detector.\\
	In Chap. \ref{subsec:setupTestTools} the test facilities are described. Tests with a neutrals particle beam were performed with the CASYMIR test facility at the University of Bern. % Ref.
	% Noch STROFIO chamber erwähnen und schreiben, welche tests man in dieser Kammer machen kann.
	% Pumpstand 2 überhaupt erwähnen? Gain Kurve mit dem einen anderen detector aufzeichnen und rein kopieren. Gibt dazu nicht viel zu schreiben.

	\subsection{NIM Sensor Models}\label{subsec:setupInst}
	In this chapter, the NIM Prototype and the design of the NIM ProtoFlight Model (PFM) are described. The Prototype was build by Stefan Meyer and he also designed the NIM PFM \cite{Diss_Meyer}. The tests in Chapter \ref{sec:Exp} start with the configuration of the instruments as they are stated in this chapter.\\
	Fig.\ref{fig:SetupProtoISSim} shows the SIMION model of the Prototype ion-source Fig.\ref{fig:SetupPFMISSim} shows the ion-source of the PFM and Fig.\ref{fig:SetupFilElSim} shows the filament housing of the Prototype (left) and of the PFM (right). The PFM has seven electrodes less then the prototype to simplify the source. Manly LV electrodes were taken together (IS 1\& 2, IS 3 \& 4, IS 6 \& 7). IS 10 was removed and IS 11 was shifted towards the ionisation region. In the filament housing the filament repeller electrodes Fil 2-5 were taken together to one single repeller electrode Fil 2. The repeller electrode was splitted in 4 to compensate the filament position in case the filament was badly adjusted. For the PFM, the mounting of the filament holder was improved, therefore these 4 electrodes could be taken together to one single electrode.\\

	% Comparison between the two designs/ types of the main structures.
	% Reflectron
	% Detector: Anode, resistor, anode is floating on MCP front. May show a simple electrical schematics of how this work. Write a fucking manual!!! That somebody else can work with the instrument from scratch. If time, write a separate document with a description!!!
	
	% Schematic of the whole instrument, where every electrode is named, zoom in the filament and the detector section to describe, which electrode does what there. Very short description about their funcitonallity. Make the description in one model and highlight the differences between the Prototype and the PFM. May show the zoom of both models at the same time to show the difference of the two models.
	
	
	
	% Fig.\ref{fig:SetupProtoISSim}-\ref{fig:} show the SIMION models of the Prototype ion-source, the filament housing, the ion-mirror and the detector. Fig.\ref{fig:SetupProto} shows the NIM Prototype as it was at the beginning of the measurement campaigns. Detailed cable schema and connection to the laboratory power supplies can be found in \cite{Diss_Meyer} Chap. 4.2.

		\subsubsection{Pumpstand nr. 2}\label{subsubsec:SetFacPumpst}
		% Add circuit schema of the detector. Have a look how to show the MCPs and the anode. May a resistor is not the best idea.
		This section describes the setup used to perform stand-alone tests with the NIM detector in Pumpstand nr.2 and shows how to calculate the voltage over the MCPs.\\

			\label{fig:Pumpstand2}
		\end{figure}
		Pumpstand nr. 2 was used to perform stand-alone tests with the different NIM detectors. The test setup consists of a vacuum chamber, a HV power supply to supply the two high voltages of the detector, an oscilloscope, a computer to remote control the oscilloscope and a HV meter (Fig. \ref{fig:Pumpstand2}).\\
		
		% Theory or experiments
		% Mechanical design, design improvements, electrical design and improvements (resistor, diode, Ri adaption to supress noise). These thing should be discussed when the schema is discussed. But the schema is also needed when showing the calculation for visualisation. In worst case, show the detector schematics twice if it is inevitable.

		\textcolor{red}{Fig. bla} shows the circuit diagram of the detector connected to an external power supply. The aim is to calculate the voltage over the MCPs $U_{MCP}$ in dependence of the voltage difference $U_{PSMCP}$ between the two outputs of the power supply $U_{PSA}$ (anode output of the power supply for the detector) and $U_{PSD}$ (MCP front voltage output of the power supply for the detector) as by the flight electronics the voltage $U_{PSMCP}$ and the drift voltage $U_{PSD}$ can be set.\\
		\begin{equation}
			U_{PSMCP} = U_{PSA} - U_{PSD}
			\label{eq:Upsmcp}
		\end{equation} % Phi_PSD is a negative voltage
		The MCPs have a voltage depended resistance which implies that we need the current $I_{MCP}$ flowing through the circuit to calculate $U_{MCP}$. As with the flight electronics it is not possible to measure this current, we do a calibration of the detector with laboratory electronics. This calibration is only valid when the detector does not come into saturation i.e. the current $I_A$ is low compared to the current $I_{RD}$ or the particle rate is below $10^6$ particles/sec.\\ % Ref. Stefan or someone else. How low? Particle rate lower than 10^6/sec -> current.
		$I_{MCP}$ is calculated by measuring the voltage over the test resistor $R_M$. $U_A$ is measured with a high voltage meter. By substituting $U_{PSA}$ with Eq.\eqref{eq:Upsmcp}, $I_{MCP}$ is then:
		\begin{equation}
			I_{MCP} = \frac{U_{PSMCP} + U_{PSD}-U_A}{R_M}
		\end{equation}
		The voltage $U_{PSMCP}$ can be written as:
		\begin{equation}
			U_{PSMCP} = U_{RM} + 2\cdot U_{Ri} + U_{RD} + U_{MCP}
			\label{eq:UpsmcpTot}
		\end{equation}
		With $U_{Ri} = I_{MCP}\cdot R_i$ the voltage over the input resistors $R_i$, which are there to damp noise coupled into the detector circuit from the power supply. In the final tests it is about 100 \si{\kilo\ohm}. $U_{RD}$ is the voltage over the diode replacement resistor $R_D$. Further explanation about the improvement of the detector can be found in chapter bla % Further comments about the developement needed.
		If the ion current $I_{ion}$ is low, this results in a low anode current $I_A$:
		\begin{equation}
			I_A = G\cdot I_{ion}
		\end{equation}
		with $G$ the MCP gain. % Order of magnitude?
		In this case $I_{MCP} = I_{RD}$ and:
		\begin{equation}
			U_{RD} = I_{MCP}\cdot R_D
		\end{equation}
		Solving Eq. \eqref{eq:UpsmcpTot} to $U_{MCP}$ results in:
		\begin{align}
			U_{MCP} =& U_{PSMCP} - U_{RM} - 2\cdot U_{Ri} - U_{RD}\\
					=& U_{PSMCP} - U_{PSMCP} + U_{PSD} - U_A - 2\cdot I_{MCP} R_i - I_{MCP} R_D\\
					=& (U_A - U_{PSD})\cdot(1 + \frac{2R_i + R_D}{R_M}) - U_{PSMCP}\frac{2R_i + R_D}{R_M}
		\end{align}

		\begin{comment}
			Add the simplified circuit diagram, The redrawn
			Include a picture of the current setup with all things marked. Make a bit a better arrangement of the devices, that it does look less like a hugh mess. Is it necessary to write something like manual for the staff? Or is it part of the Diss? One can still set up a separate file and put all things together if necessary. This then can be part of the Appendix if there is a separate manual needed.
			Same applies for the rack in the C-floor as certain devices have changed.

		Picture inside the STROFIO chamber. One picture of the current test setup with the rotation mechanism. Show on a picture where the gas enters the IS and the antechamber.
		Static gas measurement: Measurement with the STROFIO chamber with a set background gas. (Or also describe it in the different experiments? Make also a note there because then it is clear how the different measurements where performed)

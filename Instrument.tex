	This chapter compares the NIM prototype (Fig.~\ref{fig:SetupProto}) with the NIM ProtoFlight Model (PFM) (Fig.~\ref{fig:SetupPFM}) from the mechanical point of view. It shows the key differences between the two models. Special focus lay hereby on the design of the detector because there were made some major design improvements.\\
	Fig.~\ref{fig:SetupAntecham}~left shows the prototype antechamber and right the PFM antechamber. To improve the performance of the antechamber, the flight antechamber was made twice as big as the old one of the prototype. In addition, it has two entrance holes at $\pm$30° relative to the x-axis of the instrument to be able to measure gas coming from both directions of the instrument (see Chap~\ref{subsubsec:Calfly}). The main inflow direction of the neutral particle beam generated by the CASYMIR test facility is 90° \cite{CASYMIR_Graf2004}. Therefore, a second flight-like test antechamber was made which has the second entrance hole at position 90° to be able to test the flight antechamber. The antechambers consists of two parts which are hold together with screws. Tests revealed that two of the mounting screws generate signal artefacts \cite{Meyer_2017_ante}. Therefore, the outer surface of the antechamber was redesigned (see also Chap.~\ref{subsec:ExpAnteCham}).\\
	Fig.~\ref{fig:SetupProtoISSim} shows the SIMION model of the Prototype ion-source, Fig.~\ref{fig:SetupPFMISSim} shows the ion-source of the PFM and Fig.~\ref{fig:SetupFilElSim} shows the filament housing of the Prototype (left) and of the PFM (right). The PFM ion-source has seven electrodes less then the prototype to simplify the source and the flight electronics. Manly LV electrodes were taken together such as IS1\& 2, IS3 \& 4 and IS6 \& 7. IS10 was removed and IS11 was shifted towards the ionisation region. In the filament housing the electron repelling electrodes Fil2--5 were taken together to one single electrode Fil2. The electron repelling electrode in the prototype was split into four parts to compensate with the electric fields for a bad alignment of the filament. For the PFM, the mounting of the filament holder was improved and therefore these four electrodes could be taken together to one single electrode.\\
	Fig.\ref{fig:SetupProtoReflSim} shows a schematics of the ion-mirror. The prototype ion-mirror consists of 14 ring-electrodes (R2--R15). R1 is the drift tube. Between the electrodes R4--R15 are resistors to connect the electrodes with each other to generate a linear voltage gradient when a voltage is applied at electrodes R4 and R15. In addition, a voltage can be applied on electrode R8 allowing additional focusing of the ions in the ion-mirror. The flight ion-mirror consists of a ceramic tube with two resistance spirals on its inner walls replacing electrodes R5--R7 and R9--R14. From the electrical point of view, the two ion-mirrors behave the same.\\

	The NIM Prototype detector has a rigid Printed Circuit Board (PCB) on which the electrical components and the drift tube with the MCP stack are mounted (Fig.~\ref{fig:DetPhotos}~left). Due to Jupiter's strong radiation field, the detector has to be shielded to reduce the noise level induced by the strong radiation and to increase the detector's lifetime. To minimized the required shielding mass, the flight detector has to be very compact. This was achieved by using a flex PCB to fold the detector into a peek housing (Fig.~\ref{fig:DetPhotos}~right). Fig.~\ref{fig:FlightDetSchemata}~left shows the schema of a preliminary design of the peek housing containing the MCPs. The MCPs lay on a ledge 1~mm above the anode. A diode generates a voltage between the MCP backside and the anode to accelerate the electrons from the MCP backside towards the anode (see electrical schema Fig,\,\ref{fig:FlighElecSchema}). There are two contact lugs on top and at the bottom of the MCP stack to apply a voltage over the MCPs. The MCPs are fixed with a peek screw within the housing. In the old design, the screw threads were milled down to the ledge. When the MCPs were mounted, they often canted in the threads. In addition, it was not possible to determine, how much the screw had to be tightened. When the screw was tighten too much, the MCPs broke as they consist of lead glass and are therefore very fragile. When the screw was too loose, the two contact lugs had no reliable contact to the MCPs. When applying a high voltage over the whole MCP stack, the gaps between the contact lugs and the MCPs act as an additional resistors over which the voltage builds up resulting in a discharge between the electrodes and the MCPs. The discharge can propagate through the whole MCP stack and damages the readout electronics. As a consequence, the screw thread was milled less far and an additional mechanical stop was made to tighten the screw only down to that stop (Fig.\,\ref{fig:FlightDetSchemata}~right). This prevented the MCPs from canting in the screw thread thus it was not milled down to the bottom of the lower ledge and with the mechanical stop, the screw could not be tightened too much to break the MCPs. In addition, a peek space was added between the screw and the MCPs to push down the MCPs uniformly. Due to the tolerances in the manufacturing process of the different parts of the housing, metallic spacer rings are added between the peek spacer and the contact lug of the top MCP to close the resulting gap. The number of added rings varies between each detector because the gap is different for each manufactured housing. With this design, the contact between the MCPs and the contact lugs could be improved but from the electrical point of view its still not a clean electrical contact. To make the system more robust against discharges the Zener diode was exchanged through a resistor ($R_D$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:FlighElecSchema}). The flight electronics sets the voltage $U_{stack}$ between the top MCP and the anode. The MCPs and the diode act as resistors, which are connected in series. Therefore, the potential drop over the MCPs depends on the potential drop over the diode. The voltage drop over a Zener diode is 180~V independent of $U_{stack}$. Therefore, the voltage over the MCPs $U_{MCP}$ is 180~V lower than $U_{stack}$. When having a resistor $R_D$ instead of a diode, the voltage over the MCPs cannot be calculated by just having $U_{stack}$ because the resistance of the MCPs $R_{MCP}$ depends on the voltage $U_{MCP}$ applied over them. It also changes with time due to ageing because the conductive material inside the MCP channels degrades over time. Therefore, the current $I_{MCP}$ flowing through the system has to be known to be able to calculate $U_{MCP}$. The NIM flight electronics is not designed to measure this current because it was designed for a detector with a diode where a current measurement would be unnecessary. A calibration with the laboratory electronics was done to determine the relationship between $U_{stack}$ and $U_{MCP}$ (Chap.~\ref{chapExp:Det}).\\
	In the following section, $U_{MCP}$ is derived as a function of the different voltages known when measuring with laboratory electronics. Fig.~\ref{fig:FlighElecSchema} shows the circuit diagram of the detector when operated with laboratory electronics and Table~\ref{tab:ElecSchemaVariableList} summarizes the used variables. The current flowing through the MCPs $I_{MCP}$ is measured with the resistor $R_M$:
	\begin{equation}
		I_{MCP} = \frac{U_{RM}}{R_{M}}
	\end{equation}
	With $U_{RM}$ the voltage over the resistor $R_{M}$ which is:
	\begin{align}
		U_{RM} &= U_{PSA} - U_{A}\\
			   &= U_{PSMCP} + U_{PSD} - U_A
	\end{align}
	With $U_{PSA}$ the power supply output voltage for the anode, $U_{A}$ the voltage applied on the detector anode, $U_{PSD}$ the power supply output voltage applied at the top contact lug of the MCP stack and $U_{PSMCP}$ the voltage difference between the two power supply outputs. $U_{PSMCP}$ is:
	\begin{equation}
		U_{PSMCP} = U_{RM} + 2\cdot U_{Ri} + U_{RD} + U_{MCP}
		\label{eq:UpsmcpTot}
	\end{equation}
	With $U_{Ri}$ the voltage over the input resistors $R_i$, which are there to damp noise coupled into the detector circuit from the power supply:
	\begin{equation}
		U_{Ri} = I_{MCP}\cdot R_i
	\end{equation} 
	$U_{RD}$ is the voltage over the resistor $R_D$ replacing the former diode. The current $I_A$ induced when an ion generates an electron avalanche, is very low compared to the current $I_{RD}$. Therefore, $I_{MCP} = I_{RD}$ and:
	\begin{equation}
		U_{RD} = I_{MCP}\cdot R_D
	\end{equation}
	Solving Eq.~\eqref{eq:UpsmcpTot} to $U_{MCP}$ and inserting the different voltages results in:
	\begin{align}
		U_{MCP} =& U_{PSMCP} - U_{RM} - 2\cdot U_{Ri} - U_{RD}\\
				=& U_{PSMCP} - U_{PSMCP} + U_{PSD} - U_A - 2\cdot I_{MCP} R_i - I_{MCP} R_D\\
				=& (U_A - U_{PSD})\cdot(1 + \frac{2R_i + R_D}{R_M}) - U_{PSMCP}\frac{2R_i + R_D}{R_M}
	\end{align}
